Assignment: Build a replica of a Trello-esque task board, featuring draggable tasks within
columns, based on the designs on page 2. This assignment is meant to take you around 3-4
hours. If you need to make any assumptions as you code, simply note your assumptions down
and continue moving forward. If you don’t finish everything in time, please send along your plan
for the rest of the work with your code.
Functional Requirements:

1. Users can create a new card in any of the 4 columns by clicking “Add Another Card” and
   get the “Adding a new task” experience. Entering text and clicking “Add card” will create
   a new card within that column, and clicking the “X” will cancel the action. Please include
   text validation of some type and display the validation message however you like.
2. Users can drag any card to any column and reorder tasks within the column.
3. For tablet and mobile screens the experience should scroll horizontally (Mobile View).
   Technical Requirements:
4. Please build the assignment using React
5. Implement using pure CSS (no CSS frameworks or libraries).
6. Do not use a drag & drop JS library (i.e. react-draggable)
7. Develop and deliver the assignment in any way that is convenient for you (i.e. Github
   repo, codepen, send us the code files directly, etc).

Additional Notes:
● There is no database to persist the task board data for this assignment, so no need to
save state outside of a browser session. However, please come prepared to discuss how
you think a backend API would best serve this feature.
● These designs are screenshots. Don’t worry about pixel-perfection, but do try to mimic
the visual experience as much as you can.
● Support for editing and deleting tasks is not required for this assignment, but consider it
a bonus if you have extra time
