What I focused

- High-Level Requirements
- Basic Functionalities
- Edge Cases and bugs
- Component Structure
- State Data Structure
- Researching Drag and Drop feature without using libraries



What I would improve if I have more time

- Styling (Making UI responsive)
- Testing


Additional Notes:

- I wasn't very sure about text validation as all the input types are string. I added alert for empty card submission though.
- I spent some time on a careless bug and had to take all 6 hours
- It was definitely a fun Project and Thank you.
